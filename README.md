# parallax

This can be used in a constrained parallax background. This could be used for 2d infinite side-scrolling parallax but I haven't tested it yet.
There is a sample with openfl that can help use this library in any engine.

# Features

- parallax scrolling constrained by a defined world dimension
- configurable by xml (or code)
- zoom constrained by screen height
- sample (openfl)
- agnostic

# Demo

The sample can be tested here (better fullscreen): http://loudoweb.fr/app/parallax/
And here is the [xml](https://github.com/loudoweb/parallax/blob/master/assets/data/parallax.xml)

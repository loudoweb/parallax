# parallax

This can be used in a constrained parallax background. This could be used for 2d infinite side-scrolling parallax but I haven't tested it yet.
There is a sample with openfl that can help use this library in any engine.

# Features

- parallax scrolling constrained by a defined world dimension
- configurable by xml (or code)
- zoom
- sample (openfl)
- agnostic

# Demo

The sample can be tested here (better fullscreen): http://loudoweb.fr/app/parallax/
	
# known issue

The app is constrained by the world dimension. But it lacks screen dimension constrain. So now the app works better fullscreen. (A fix is coming).

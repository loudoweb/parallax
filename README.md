# parallax
This can be used in a constrained parallax background. This could be used for 2d side-scrolling parallax but I haven't tested it yet.
Openfl for now. Could be agnostic later.

# TODO
✅ simple bg scrolling
✅ make it configurable
✅ use xml config
✅ add parallax layer
✅ sample (openfl)
- [ ] zoom
- [ ] agnostic
